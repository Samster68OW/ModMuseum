# Outer Wilds Mod Museum
The Observatory is expanding! Visit a new wing of the museum that includes exhibits, characters, and artwork from across the Outer Wilds modding community. If you would like to donate a piece for the museum, reach out to us on the Discord server. If you record/stream yourself playing this mod, we would love to see it!
